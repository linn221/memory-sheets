- htmx will not swap if status code is 204, **hx-swab-oob** will not conflict with normal swap, hx-target will be ignored.
- **HX-Location: /location** header will fetch the location, then swap the response to hx-target, instead of redirecting and reloading the page
- text input with hx-get will send the request to hx-get, input name as query, GET $hx-get?$name=$value
- `hx-target="this" hx-swap="outerHTML"` pattern is conventional for swapping the component/click to edit, etc
